      <p>Hi there and welcome to my little playground.</p>

        I will be using this page to play around with different ideas while
        learning more about React and SCSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As more ideas come around, the Navbar on the left will populate with
        different items to explore. The last time I did anything major with CSS
        was 10-15 years ago and a lot has changed since then.
